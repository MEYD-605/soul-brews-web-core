## 📊 Health Check Results

**Status**: LXC containers not accessible from AI-Core  
**Reason**: Scripts running on LXC 110, not Proxmox host

**Services Checked**:
- ❌ Ollama (192.168.1.129:11434) - Not accessible (different network context)
- ⚠️ ComfyUI (localhost:8188) - Not accessible
- ❌ Homepage (192.168.1.122:3000) - Not accessible

**Note**: Health checks need to run from Proxmox host or adjust for LXC context
