## 🔱 The Great Alignment of LXC 110

This record serves as a permanent memory of the recovery and stabilization efforts performed on **2026-01-04**. It captures the essence of systemic integrity for the Oracle MAW.

### 🛡️ Core Lesson 1: The Sovereignty of Environment
- **Insight:** The boundary between the **Hypervisor (Proxmox Host: clubsxno1)** and the **AI Core (LXC 110)** must be absolute.
- **Action:** Never execute environment-specific AI installation or data manipulation commands on the host. The host is the protector; the LXC is the brain.
- **Impact:** Prevents host-level bloat and ensures the AI environment remains portable and isolated.

### ⚡ Core Lesson 2: The Strength of Simplicity (Lean MCP)
- **Insight:** Complexity is the enemy of stability. A bloated MCP fleet creates noise and overhead.
- **Action:** Simplified the MCP configuration to the **Four Pillars**:
    1.  **Filesystem**: Physical interaction.
    2.  **Shell**: Executive control.
    3.  **GitHub**: External collaboration.
    4.  **Brave Search**: Real-time intelligence.
- **Impact:** Reduced response latency and cleared cognitive overhead for the Oracle models.

### 🧠 Core Lesson 3: The "No.1" Stabilization Strategy
- **Insight:** High-performance hardware (Intel Ultra 9 285H) requires precise resource management.
- **Action:** 
    - Isolated ZFS ARC to 6GB on the host to prioritize I/O for the AI Core.
    - Unified the AI Fleet on **Gemma 3 12B** (GPU) and **Gemma 2 9B** (Ollama) as the stable "Duo".
- **Impact:** Achieved a stable 30s response time with 14GB of context-aware memory.

### ♾️ Perennial Principles
1.  **Verify Before Expansion**: Always audit the current state before adding new models.
2.  **Deduplicate Memory**: 14GB of garbage memory is weaker than 234MB of pure wisdom.
3.  **The Shadow Protects**: Use simulation and shadow modes for testing before full NPU deployment.
